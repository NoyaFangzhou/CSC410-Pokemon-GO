# CSC410-Pokemon-GO
CSC410 Final Project

This is the final project of our CSC410 Web Programming course.

We plan to develop a forum focus on Pokemon Go, just like a combination of Instgram, Wechat Moment and Twitter.
In this website, user can share their pokemon go gaming experience and feelings with others and their post can be seen by people
who follow them only.

At the front, we use HTML/CSS, Javascript, Ajax, jQuery to build the UI, exchange data and handle user interactions.
For pursuing better UI, we embedded bootstrap framework as our CSS

At the backend, we use Python as our main CGI script, cooperate with SQL database.
